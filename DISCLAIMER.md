## No Financial Advice

Nothing in this repository — code, documentation, backtest results, or
any output produced by running it — constitutes financial advice,
investment advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any
security.  Consult a licensed financial advisor before making any
trading or investment decisions.

## No Guarantee of Accuracy or Profitability

- Backtest results illustrate how a strategy *would have performed* on
  historical data.  Past performance **does not** predict future results.
- Market conditions, liquidity, slippage, and countless other factors
  mean that live results will differ from backtests — often
  significantly.
- The models, signals, and execution logic in this codebase have not
  been audited by any regulatory body and carry no certification.

## Use at Your Own Risk

- You assume **all** risk associated with running, deploying, or acting
  on the output of this software.
- The authors and contributors accept **no liability** for any financial
  loss, trading loss, or other damage — direct or indirect — that may
  result from the use of this software in any form.

## No Warranty

This software is provided **"as is,"** without warranty of any kind —
express or implied.  This includes, but is not limited to, warranties
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
non-infringement.

## Paper Trading First

If you choose to connect this system to a real brokerage account, you
**must** run in paper-trading mode for an extended period first.  The
default configuration (`paper_trading = True`) is intentional.  Switching
to live capital is a deliberate, conscious act that should be preceded
by thorough review of risk parameters and a full understanding of the
code.

## Regulatory Compliance

Algorithmic trading is regulated in most jurisdictions.  It is your
responsibility to ensure that any use of this software complies with
applicable laws and regulations in your region.
